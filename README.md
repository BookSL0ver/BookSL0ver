### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
- My name is Jay (they/them) and I am a programmer, currently working as a Systems Administrator, that graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Madison with a Bachelor of Sciences in Computer Science and minors in Studio Art and Game Design. 
- I know it's cheesy to say, but I do love programming. There's something endlessly inspiring about the process of researching a problem, finding possible solutions, determining the best one, implementing said solution, then testing it to see if it works how you thought it would, and then starting all over again. The thrill of deploying a project to the public or within a company that I or my team have spent countless hours working on is something I can't find anywhere else.
