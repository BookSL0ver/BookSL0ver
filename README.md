### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
- My name is Jay (they/them) and I am a programmer, currently working as a Systems Administrator, that graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Madison with a Bachelor of Sciences in Computer Science and minors in Studio Art and Game Design. 
- I know it's cheesy to say, but I do love programming. There's something endlessly inspiring about the process of finding (or being told about) and issue, researching that issue, finding a solution for it through programming, and then starting all over again. The thrill of deploying a project to the public or within a company that I or my team have spent countless hours working on is something I can't find anywhere else.
